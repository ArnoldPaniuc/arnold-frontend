    <h3>To say players are unhappy would be something of an understatement</h3>

    <p>Online vehicular shooter War Thunder made some changes to the way its economy works recently, and players of the game are so upset that not only have they review-bombed the game to hell and back, but the developers have been forced to take extremely apologetic actions in response.
        Basically, a game that has over the years become increasingly pay-to-win—as well as becoming a dumping ground for state secrets—recently implemented economy changes that made it even harder to get anything out of the game—especially progression—unless you were regularly spending actual money.
        Players, fed up with the exploitation, did one of the few things available to them: they took to Steam to leave negative feedback, posting thousands of messages protesting the changes and attacking developers Gaijin. At time of publishing the game’s Steam review section looked like this:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td style="border: 3px solid black;" bgcolor="#00ff80"><b>I didn’t want to leave a negative review, but Gaijin’s blatant contempt for their own players has forced my hand.</b></td>
            <td style="border: 3px solid black;" bgcolor="#00ff80" rowspan="3"><b>For the new players reading this, Gaijin has recently admitted that they balance free vehicles around a negative SL income for average players. That means they WANT you to lose money by playing, so you’ll be forced to buy a top tier premium vehicle.</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td style="border: 3px solid black;" bgcolor="#00ff80"><b>War Thunder is a game like no other, with a comprehensive damage system, combined arms, and variety of beautifully modeled tanks, aircraft and ships.</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td style="border: 3px solid black;" bgcolor="#00ff80"><b>Unfortunately, this “uniqueness” has left Gaijin with little real competition over the years. What started off as a “free to play” title has over time become less and less free. Gaijin keeps adding nations and vehicles, while at the same time increasing repair costs and lowering RP/SL gain. A premium account isn’t enough to comfortably progress anymore, now you also have to buy premium vehicles in every nation.</b></td>
